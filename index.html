        Dar es Salaam combines the clamor of Tanzania's largest city with an agreeably relaxed pace of life. Unlike other cities in East Africa, this is not the sort of city where you see lots of other travelers. This makes it a wonderful opportunity to get a glimpse of urban African life as locals live it. Immerse yourself in its markets and street-food scenes, explore its museums, and enjoy its outdoor attractions. There's all this and more in our guide of what to do in Dar es Salaam.

                    <h3>Shop the Markets</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>To really experience the sights and smells of an authentically
                         Tanzanian market, it just has to be Kariakoo Market. Spread across a number of busy city blocks,
                          it's filled with everything from household goods to clothing and food. More touristy but with more crafts, 
                          Mwenge Carvers' Market has an excellent blend of pieces made for tourists alongside genuine
                           traditional items.

                    <h3>Find the Best Street Food</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>You'll eat well in Dar es Salaam, and what locals crave more than anything is a 
                        street barbecue. Every evening queues form at aromatic Barbecue House, close to Ali 
                        Hassan Mwinyi Road. Here locals order chicken, beef or fish, served with naan bread and a choice of
                         chilies, coconut chutney or tamarind sauce. It's a similar deal at Mamboz Corner, where Morogoro Road 
                         meets Libya Street, with Zanzibari marinades a highlight. Four times a year, the Nyama Choma Festival (Swahili for grilled meats)
                          takes over Tunisia Road with barbecue cook-offs and live entertainment.

                    <h3>Visit the Fish Market</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Kivukoni Fish Market is a real Dar experience, especially in the early morning when fisherfolk hawk their fish and other
                         seafood to local restaurant and home chefs. It's a fabulous experience, filled with local color, salespeople shouting to make 
                         themselves heard, and some rather pungent smells. Even if you're not in the market for something to cook for dinner, you'll love the 
                         experience. It's one of the least touristy things to do in Dar es Salaam.

                    <hr>
                    <p>Locals in Dar es Salaam love a day at the beach, and with balmy temperatures year-round, 
                        it's always a good choice for when you're in town. There are plenty to choose from, 
                        but Coco Beach, on the Msasani Peninsula north of town, is a real favorite. 
                        It offers the chance to mingle with locals enjoying the food stalls, wandering minstrels selling beer and coconuts, 
                        and live music. The beaches out on Bongoyo Island are quieter and just as worthwhile.

                    <hr>
                    <p>The Indian Ocean off Dar is an underrated destination for diving, snorkeling, 
                        and just escaping the city to sail around beautiful local islands such as Bongoyo, 
                        Pangavini and Mbudya. The Dar es Salaam Yacht Club runs sailing and fishing excursions, 
                        and, once back on shore, if you can take out a temporary membership you can use the club's 
                        facilities, which include a swimming pool and a children's playground.

                    <hr>
                    <p>Tanzania's capital in all but name, the city has some excellent museums, and they're among the best things to do in Dar es Salaam.
                         The biggest and best is the National Museum, which takes you on an intriguing journey through Tanzanian history.
                          It begins with world-famous archaeological finds from Olduvai Gorge, then travels down through the slave trade and colonial era,
                           and even houses former president Julius Nyerere's Rolls-Royce. The Village Museum has reconstructed village scenes from all corners of the country,
                         with live cultural performances and craftspeople at work to bring it all alive.
